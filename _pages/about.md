I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at Beijing Normal University. My research focuses on the gavitational lensing and plasma lensing effects of FRB (Fast Radio Burst). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Astrophysics from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2022, and BA from Shandong Normal University in 2016. My past research include the study of microlensing effects from point-mass objects, the development and application of micro-image search algorithms, and theoretical interpretations for a sudden quench event in an active repeating FRB from the point view of plasma lensing.
