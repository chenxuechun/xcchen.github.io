I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at Beijing Normal University. I obtained my Ph. D. in Astrophysics from the University of Science and Technology of China after completing my undergraduate studies at Shandong Normal University. I specialize in astrophysics with an interest in the gavitational lensing and plasma lensing effects of FRB (Fast Radio Burst). My past research include the study of microlensing effects from point-mass objects, the development and application of micro-image search algorithms, and theoretical interpretations for a sudden quench event in an active repeating FRB from the point view of plasma lensing.
